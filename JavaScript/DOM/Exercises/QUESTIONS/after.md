ðŸ”§ JavaScript after() Method Interview Questions
ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Understanding

    What does the after() method do in the DOM, and how does it differ from appendChild() or append()?

    Can you explain the difference between after() and insertAdjacentElement() with the "afterend" position?

    Which DOM nodes can call the after() method, and what types of arguments can it accept?

    Is after() called on the parent node or the target node? Explain the implication of this in terms of usage.

    What happens if after() is used on a node that is not attached to the DOM? Will it throw an error?

ðŸ”¨ Practical Usage

    Write JavaScript code that inserts a new <div class="note"> immediately after an existing element with the class card.

    How would you use after() to display a success message below a form element after submission?

    Demonstrate how to dynamically create and insert a text node after a heading tag.

    Create a function that accepts an element and inserts a new timestamp <span> after it using after().

    How would you use after() in a loop to insert separators (like <hr>) after each list item except the last?

ðŸ§  Advanced Use & Edge Cases

    Can after() insert multiple nodes or mixed content (text + elements)? If so, how are they handled internally?

    How does the after() method behave when working with a DocumentFragment? Are all fragment children inserted?

    Compare the use of after() and append() in terms of DOM tree structure and performance.

    What are the browser compatibility considerations when using after()? How would you polyfill it in legacy environments?

    Can you use after() inside special DOM contexts like Shadow DOM or within SVG elements? What limitations or quirks should you be aware of?
